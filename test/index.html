            JavaScript, standardized under the title of ECMAScript, is a dynamic programming language.[6]
            It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed.[6] JavaScript (at least the strict subset asm.js) is also considered an "assembly language of the web"[7] – a compile target of source-to-source compilers – for making client side web applications, using other programming languages, supported by all the major browsers without plug-ins. It is also used in server-side network programming with runtime environments such as Node.js, game development and the creation of desktop and mobile applications.
